# üöÄ Panduan Simulasi dengan Wokwi üîç

This document provides a comprehensive guide to simulating this SSD1306 project using **Wokwi**. With Wokwi, you can run, test, and interact with your code on a virtual ESP32 directly from Visual Studio Code, **without requiring physical hardware**.

This method is ideal for rapid development, debugging, and ensuring your code works before flashing it to a real device.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Simulation in Visual Studio Code

This approach integrates Wokwi into your development workflow in VS Code, allowing you to view simulation results in real-time.

For more in-depth information, refer to the official documentation at **[Wokwi for VS Code](https://docs.wokwi.com/vscode/getting-started)**.

### ‚úÖ Prerequisites

Ensure you meet the following requirements:

- ‚úîÔ∏è **Visual Studio Code** is installed.
- ‚úîÔ∏è This project has been cloned to your computer.
- ‚úîÔ∏è The **[Wokwi for VS Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Wokwi.wokwi-vscode)** extension is installed from the Marketplace.

### üìã Project Configuration

To enable simulation, add the following configuration files to the root directory of your project.

1. **Copy Configuration Files**:
   Copy the `diagram.json` and `wokwi.toml` files from the `assets/wokwi/` folder in this repository.

   ```
   assets/wokwi/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ diagram.json
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wokwi.toml
   ```

   Move both files to your project‚Äôs root directory, alongside `platformio.ini` or `CMakeLists.txt`.

2. **Configuration File Contents (For Reference)**:
   <details>
   <summary>View contents of <code>wokwi.toml</code></summary>

   ```toml
   # File: wokwi.toml
   # This configuration tells Wokwi where to find the compiled firmware.
   [wokwi]
   version = 1
   firmware = '.pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.bin' # For PlatformIO
   elf = '.pio/build/esp32dev/firmware.elf'      # For PlatformIO
   # If using pure ESP-IDF, adjust the path to the 'build/' folder.
   ```
   </details>

### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the Simulation

Follow these three simple steps to start the simulation.

1. **üõ†Ô∏è Build the Project**  
   Before simulating, you **must** compile the project to generate the `.bin` and `.elf` files required by Wokwi.
   - **PlatformIO**: `pio run`
   - **ESP-IDF**: `idf.py build`

2. **üöÄ Start the Simulator**  
   Open the *Command Palette* in VS Code (`F1` or `Ctrl+Shift+P`), then type and select:  
   `Wokwi: Start Simulator`

3. **üëÄ View the Results**  
   A new tab will open in VS Code displaying your virtual circuit diagram. The simulation will run automatically:
   - The OLED display will light up and show graphical output.
   - Logs from `ESP_LOG` will appear in the VS Code "Serial Monitor" panel.

### üí° Additional Tips

- **Update Code? Rebuild!** Whenever you modify your code, rerun the build command before restarting the simulation to ensure Wokwi loads the latest firmware.
- **Interactive Experience.** Click components in the diagram (e.g., buttons or sensors, if included) to interact with them during simulation.
- **Customize the Circuit.** The `diagram.json` file is highly flexible. You can add other components like DHT22 sensors, LEDs, potentiometers, and more. Check the [Wokwi documentation](https://docs.wokwi.com/parts/wokwi-dht22) for a full list of supported parts.
